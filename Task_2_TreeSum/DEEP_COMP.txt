Write a deepComp function to deeply compare the values passed to it.
Values can be numbers, strings, booleans, hashes, null, undefined, arrays, incl. any level of investment.
Note that the for..in loop does not guarantee that the hash keys will be iterated over in any order.
Don't use Object.is ().
Write tests for the function to work correctly
