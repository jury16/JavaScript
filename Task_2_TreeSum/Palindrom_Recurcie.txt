Write a clean function that checks that the phrase passed to it is a palindrome using recursion.
Do not use arrays in the decision.
The check should ignore:
  - case of letters;
  - spaces;
  - punctuation marks;
  - soft and hard signs;
  - the difference between the letters "e" and "e".
Attention: it is not necessary to clear the string of ignored characters using recursion; recursion should only be used when checking if a cleared string is a palindrome.
