Develop a "pure" treeSum function that receives an array whose elements are
can be numbers or again arrays, and so on to any level.
The function should calculate and return the sum of all numeric elements of the array from all

When writing a function, do not describe any functions nested in it.
You can check the operation of the function on the following array (sum 50):
[5, 7,
[4, [2], 8, [1,3], 2],
[ nine, [] ],
eighteen
]
