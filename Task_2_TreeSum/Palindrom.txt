Write a clean function that checks that the phrase passed to it is a palindrome.
(A palindrome is a phrase that reads from left to right the same way as from right to left)
Do not use arrays in the decision.
The check should ignore:
  - case of letters;
  - spaces;
  - punctuation marks;
  - soft and hard signs;
  - the difference between the letters "e" and "e".
Ask the user for a string. Display the message "this is a palindrome" or "this is not a palindrome" via alert.
