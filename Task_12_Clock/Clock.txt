Create project CLOCK_DOM. Implement DOM methods to show the current
time and clock running in real time according to the layout below.
Clock digits are not hardcoded, create them and calculate their positions in the cycle.
Do not use any "magic constants" in the code - move all constants into
the beginning of a script with clear documentation.
