Make up the VALID_FORM project according to the sample.</br>
Make validation of input values; think over the validation rules yourself,</br>
describe them in the comments; at least an empty (initial) value for each of the fields</br>
should be considered erroneous.</br>
When leaving the text field of the form or changing the checkbox, radio group, drop-down</br>
list - validate only this field and, in case of an error, an error message</br>
immediately display next to the field (error messages next to other fields should not</br>
wash); Allow the user to leave the field, even if it is filled in with an error.</br>
When trying to submit a form - validate all fields at once and display all at once</br>
error messages next to erroneously filled fields; scroll the page to</br>
the first erroneously filled field, focus this field.</br>
As a script that processes the form data (the action attribute of the form tag), you can</br>
install https://fe.it-academy.by/TestForm.php
