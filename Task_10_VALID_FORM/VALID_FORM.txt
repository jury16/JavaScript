Make up the VALID_FORM project according to the sample.
Make validation of input values; think over the validation rules yourself,
describe them in the comments; at least an empty (initial) value for each of the fields
should be considered erroneous.
When leaving the text field of the form or changing the checkbox, radio group, drop-down
list - validate only this field and, in case of an error, an error message
immediately display next to the field (error messages next to other fields should not
wash); Allow the user to leave the field, even if it is filled in with an error.
When trying to submit a form - validate all fields at once and display all at once
error messages next to erroneously filled fields; scroll the page to
the first erroneously filled field, focus this field.
As a script that processes the form data (the action attribute of the form tag), you can
install https://fe.it-academy.by/TestForm.php
