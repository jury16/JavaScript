<p>Implement the game "Tennis" using DOM methods (TENNIS_DOM project).</p>
<p>The ball bounces on the field, the rackets beat it off to the left and right.</p>
<p>The size of the field is NOT rubbery, it must be set at the JavaScript-code level with constants.</p>
<p>Launching the ball - on the "start!" Button, while the ball flies out directly from the middle of the field in a random direction at a random (reasonably) angle.</p>
<p>Controlling the left paddle - using the Shift (up) and Ctrl (down) keys, right racket - "up arrow" and "down arrow". As long as the key is held down the racket moves smoothly; key released - the racket stops.</p>
<p>If the racket bounces the ball, the ball must bounce off the racket (and not reach walls through the racket).</p>
<p>If the ball reaches the left or right wall, a goal is counted (counting points) and until the next press "start!" the ball is stopped near the wall, touching her.</p>
<p>Do not use any "magic constants" in the code - move all constants into the beginning of a script with clear documentation.</p>
