<p>Implement in JavaScript the mouse dragging on a web page of any of several (but not small) images. Handle at least mousedown, mousemove, mouseup.</p>
<p>Images should be "dragged" by the mouse over any point (i.e., both when "picking up" and "Release" the image should not move, it should only move when moving the mouse while holding down the left button, exactly as far as the mouse is displaced).</p>
<p>The code should not depend on the number of pictures (i.e. the code should find all images that are in the specified div container).</p>
<p>Pictures should NOT initially be positioned (position should not be specified).</p>
<p>When you start dragging a picture, the rest of the pictures should not move.</p>
<p>The picture you started dragging should appear higher (closer to the eyes),than the rest.</p>
<p>While dragging, change the cursor shape to a suitable one.</p>
