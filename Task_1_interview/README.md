<p>Create project Inreview. Ask the user:</p>
<p>surname, name, patronymic SEPARATE (by the prompt operator)</p>
<p>age in years (by the prompt operator)</p>
<p>gender (with a confirm operator, for example, "is your gender male?")</p>
<p>and display the user's profile with the alert operator, for example:</p>
<p>your name: Ivanov Ivan Ivanovich</p>
<p>your age in years: 20</p>
<p>your age in days: 7300</p>
<p>in 5 years you will be: 25</p>
<p>your gender: male</p>
<p>you are retired: no</p>
<p>There should be control over the correctness of the data entered by the user (for example, the surname must not be empty, age must be the correct number, etc.).</p>
<p>The alert statement must be used exactly once in your code.</p>
