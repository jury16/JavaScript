Create project Inreview. Ask the user:
surname, name, patronymic SEPARATE (by the prompt operator)
age in years (by the prompt operator)
gender (with a confirm operator, for example, "is your gender male?")
and display the user's profile with the alert operator, for example:
your name: Ivanov Ivan Ivanovich
your age in years: 20
your age in days: 7300
in 5 years you will be: 25
your gender: male
you are retired: no
There should be control over the correctness of the data entered by the user (for example,
the surname must not be empty, age must be the correct number, etc.).
The alert statement must be used exactly once in your code.
